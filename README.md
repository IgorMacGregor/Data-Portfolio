# Data Portfolio - Gr√©goire E.

Hi ! In this repository, you will find all my data-related projects, mostly coming from Kaggle which I used a lot to self-learn Data Analysis and Data Science. 

I will add new projects regularly as I find interesting datasets to work on. I am looking for an internship/contract in January 2021, so feel free to contact me if I could fit your needs ! :)

## Data Analysis

- [*New* - NY Shootings EDA](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/IgorMacGregor/Data-Portfolio/blob/master/projects/new-york-shootings-eda.ipynb) : a detailed analysis of shooting incidents in New York between 2006 and 2019. Libraries used: Numpy, Pandas, Plotly, Folium
- [Peace Agreements since 1990](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/IgorMacGregor/Data-Portfolio/blob/master/projects/peace-in-the-world-since-1990.ipynb) : an analysis of a Peace Agreements dataset for the period 1990-2016. Libraries used: Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly
- [Which is the best international football team?](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/IgorMacGregor/Data-Portfolio/blob/master/projects/which-is-the-best-international-football-team.ipynb) : statistics and ranking from an international games dataset, for the period 1872-2020. Libraries used: Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Plotly
- [Basketball Games Analysis](https://github.com/IgorMacGregor/Data-Portfolio/blob/master/projects/2020-march-madness-eda.ipynb) : exploratory data analysis of a basketball games dataset. Libraries used: Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Machine Learning

- [M5 Forecasting - Accuracy](https://github.com/IgorMacGregor/Data-Portfolio/blob/master/projects/m5-forecasting-accuracy.ipynb) : submission to a Kaggle competition with a team, where we had to predict the future sales of several Walmart supermarkets. Libraries used: Numpy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, LightGBM
- [2019 Data Science Bowl](https://github.com/IgorMacGregor/Data-Portfolio/blob/master/projects/data-science-bowl-2019.ipynb) : submission to a Kaggle competition, where I had to predict the aptitude of children to complete an assessment on a gaming app. Libraries used: Numpy, Pandas, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, LightGBM, Catboost, XGB
- [European Soccer Project](https://github.com/IgorMacGregor/Data-Portfolio/blob/master/projects/European%20Soccer%20Prediction.pdf) : academic project done with another student, where we predict the outcome of football games thanks to various algorithms, and perform Time Series Analysis on the attendance of the European football stadiums. Technologies used : Knime, R (for TSA)
